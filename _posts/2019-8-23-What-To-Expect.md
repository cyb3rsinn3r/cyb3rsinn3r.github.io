Me? Making a blog? I know, I know - that's what I was thinking too. But then I found out how easy it is to create and maintain a hacking-related blog on Github so I figured I'd give it a shot. Every blogger aims to post new content on a regular basis, be that daily, weekly, monthly, whatever. Since I'm not one who does well with keeping a regular schedule for my hobbies, I can't guarantee when I will be posting stuff. But I can guarantee that I'll be posting stuff about hacking (capture the flag), my Raspberry Pi and different things I do with it, and the other hobbies I enjoy: hiking, rockets, r/c airplanes, you know...g33k stuff.

Until then, enjoy staring at this mostly blank space! Thanks for visiting!
