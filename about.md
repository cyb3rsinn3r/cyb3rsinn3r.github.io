Just another Security Engineer with a blog.

### About Me

In my professional life I'm a Security Engineer working with Intrusion Detection Systems and Threat Intelligence. I'm a CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) and hold the following certifications from CompTIA: A+, Network+, Security+, CySA+ (Cyber Security Analyst), and CASP (Advanced Security Professional).

In my personal life I'm a husband, dad, and dog owner. I work from home in Colorado and enjoy everything this state has to offer. When I'm not outside geocaching, hiking, or playing PokemonGo I can usually be found doing various capture the flag exercises or playing a variety of PC games.
